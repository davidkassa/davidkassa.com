But my resolution isn't the stereotypical \"lose weight\" or \"exercise more\". As you probably figured, it's to **_Do More Doing_**.\n\nAs stupid as it sounds, I almost convinced myself not to exercise to not be one of the sheeple that make this resolution year after year. However, I took a step back and decided that I need to _**Do More Doing**_.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I had some great success hiring a personal trainer at [Orange Shoe Gym](http://www.orangeshoegym.com/ \"Orange Shoe Gym\"). I lost nearly 30 pounds in 4 months! It was great and I thought I had successfully changed my lifestyle so that I would keep the weight off. I was wrong. I stopped working out only a couple of months after I stopped my personal training.\n\nThis time I'm taking what I learned from my personal training and trying again. There are 2 actions that need to take place to stay successful, cardio exercise 3x/week and maintaining an appropriate diet.\n\n### Exercise\n\nThe best way I learned to lose weight is to exercise for 30 minutes at 80% maximum heart rate several times a week. When I had my personal trainer, I used [Polar F6 Men's Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Black Coal, New Design)](http://www.amazon.com/Polar-Heart-Monitor-Watch-Design/dp/B00136U9TW%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJSZ57NV2XMMHIAUA%26tag%3Ddakadomodo0e-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00136U9TW) to make sure I was in the correct percentage or zone. It works great and you can use it no matter what exercises you decide to do. It's pretty expensive, though, so if you are working out at a gym or have a treadmill I would recommend that you just get the [Polar T31 Non-Coded Transmitter and Belt Set](http://www.amazon.com/Polar-T31-Non-Coded-Transmitter-Belt/dp/B0015RWZQ4%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJSZ57NV2XMMHIAUA%26tag%3Ddakadomodo0e-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0015RWZQ4). You can wear this belt around your chest and it will transmit your heart rate to your exercise equipment. You don't need to try to use the metal handles while you're running and your heart rate is recorded the entire time.\n\n### Diet\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate diet, I'm trying to use an iPhone app called [Lose It!](http://www.loseit.com/). After entering a bit of information, it will tell you how many calories you can consume daily and how long it will take you to achieve your goal. It  has nearly any food you can think of already programmed in it and you can add whatever it doesn't have. In version 2.0 website synchronization (with additional charts and graphs), email reminders and summaries, social media integration, and friends have been added. These are meant to help motivate you to keep on keeping on. Feel free to add me as a friend and maybe we can motivate each other.\n\nAnother motivator is the current [Million Pound Challenge](http://www.princetonclub.net/mpc/) that Princeton Club and Second Harvest are sponsoring. For every pound of weight lost they will donate 10 pounds of food to a pantry of your choice. Sounds like a win-win to me. You do not need to be a Princeton Club member to participate. (And on a side note, you will likely donate more food by using the \"exercising\" vs. \"weight loss\" selection).\n\n**Happy New Year!**","source":"_posts/exercising-new-years-resolution.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Exercising - New Year's Resolution\ntags:\n  - doing\n  - exercise\nid: 22\ndate: 2010-01-06 22:07:33\n---\n\nAs part of my new year's resolution I started exercising again.

I asked to take him to lunch and he accepted for Thursday.\n\nMy meeting with him was awesome. Definitely worth the price of a lunch. He told me to look at major internet competitors and make sure that I'm not competing with them directly. He was able to mention a couple of [indirect] competitors that I didn't see before. He also mentioned his marketing and roll-out techniques. He had great success with bridal shows and hand-written letters to vendors. He wished that he spent more time and money in SEO and getting a first page listing for common search terms like \"madison wedding planning\". He seemed pretty critical of the industry saying that it was too saturated and too late to start in. I suppose that comes from his slightly skewed point of view. The best part is that he's willing to answer any questions that I may have in the future.\n\nThe second person that I identified was actually a group, [Capital Entrepreneurs](http://www.capitalentrepreneurs.com/). They are a local entrepreneurship group that meets regularly to help each other by sharing successes, failures, and resources. I contacted them expressing my interests in joining the group. They welcomed me without any reservations and I look forward to meeting up with them for the first time next month.\n\nThe final person I identified to help me with my goals was a multiple-choice peer. I was determined to meet the Wednesday night goal so I decided that I would talk to one of three people in the [Madison Area Software Developers Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/softwaredev-113/). I picked three people from the RSVP list to approach during the event and discuss what they have done with their software start-ups and what they think about my goals.\n\nOne of the predetermined people did not show up but the other two did and I talked extensively to Josh.

He told me to focus my call-to-action to one single thing. For example, focus on gathering newsletter users until there is a working product then switch it to focus to only the search grid. He suggested asking a single question on the homepage to suck the customer in. For example, \"How many people will be at your wedding?\". Finally, he suggested that I stop worrying about the revenue and start by tracking everything so I have competitive metrics to provide to wedding venues. This was the best advice of the week.

Being a reader with a little “getting old motivation”,  I took this challenge.</p>\n<p>I contacted a founder of <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wedgenius\">WedGenius </a>(which no longer exists) to see what advice he would have to somebody entering the online wedding industry and to learn from his past experiences. I asked to take him to lunch and he accepted for Thursday.</p>\n<p>My meeting with him was awesome. Definitely worth the price of a lunch. He told me to look at major internet competitors and make sure that I’m not competing with them directly. He was able to mention a couple of [indirect] competitors that I didn’t see before. He also mentioned his marketing and roll-out techniques. He had great success with bridal shows and hand-written letters to vendors. He wished that he spent more time and money in SEO and getting a first page listing for common search terms like “madison wedding planning”. He seemed pretty critical of the industry saying that it was too saturated and too late to start in. I suppose that comes from his slightly skewed point of view. The best part is that he’s willing to answer any questions that I may have in the future.</p>\n<p>The second person that I identified was actually a group, <a href=\"http://www.capitalentrepreneurs.com/\">Capital Entrepreneurs</a>. They are a local entrepreneurship group that meets regularly to help each other by sharing successes, failures, and resources. I contacted them expressing my interests in joining the group. They welcomed me without any reservations and I look forward to meeting up with them for the first time next month.</p>\n<p>The final person I identified to help me with my goals was a multiple-choice peer. I was determined to meet the Wednesday night goal so I decided that I would talk to one of three people in the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/softwaredev-113/\">Madison Area Software Developers Meetup Group</a>. I picked three people from the RSVP list to approach during the event and discuss what they have done with their software start-ups and what they think about my goals.</p>\n<p>One of the predetermined people did not show up but the other two did and I talked extensively to Josh. He and the rest of the group gave me possible pivot points. They also gave me some insights on technical integrations like whether or not to use google maps. (Short answer is no).</p>\n<p>As a bonus, I talked to Assaf (check out his site <a href=\"http://clickdummy.net/\">Clickdummy</a>) and received some fantastic feedback on <a href=\"http://www.wedplaces.com/\">WedPlaces</a>. He told me to focus my call-to-action to one single thing. For example, focus on gathering newsletter users until there is a working product then switch it to focus to only the search grid. He suggested asking a single question on the homepage to suck the customer in. For example, “How many people will be at your wedding?”. Finally, he suggested that I stop worrying about the revenue and start by tracking everything so I have competitive metrics to provide to wedding venues. This was the best advice of the week. He also got me the best birthday shirt ever. I’ll post some pictures of me in it soon.</p>\n<p>So I did a lot of <strong>doing </strong>even if most of it was talking and meetings – apparently meeting can be productive.</p>\n"},{"title":"Security is an online right","id":"78","date":"2010-03-22T22:41:20.000Z","_content":"\nThis is one of my pet-peeves courtesy of  [37Signals](http://campfirenow.com/signup) (who I usually enjoy).\n\n[![](http://www.davidkassa.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/security-300x231.png \"Campfire &quot;upgrade&quot;\")](http://www.davidkassa.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/security.png)\n\nSecurity should not be an \"upgrade\" or an additional \"feature\" that needs to be paid for.

You will get up to the 25,000 points mentioned in my post. I also get some points for referrals.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI just received my new Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express in the mail and can't wait to use it! Not only because I'll be booking my trip to Paris ([Trip-It](http://www.tripit.com/trip/public/id/BA07653D1ED7  )) with it but because it is a great credit card to have in my arsenal.\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Sign-up Bonus\n*   Earn 1 Starpoints for every dollar spent and 2 points for every dollar at a Starwood hotel.\n*   Transfer 20,000 points into 25,000 miles for almost any frequent flyer program\n*   Starwood points can easily be transferred between any user in the same household with a phone call\n\n### Sign-up Bonus\n\nAfter my 1st purchase I will receive 10,000 Starpoints and after spending $15,000 in 6 months I will receive an additional 15,000 Starpoints. What does all this mean? Lets break it down:\n\nLooking at mid-April,\n\nI could stay at [W Chicago - City Center](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=97509) (category 5) for a weekend and spend 24,000 of my points (12k/night). This hotel has earned the AAA four diamond award for the last 3 years and costs $239/night. This comes out to $478 or a value of 1.99 cents a point.\n\nMore realistically I might go to Minneapolis and stay at the [Westin Edina Galleria](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1799) (category 3) for 3 nights and spend 21,000 of my points (7k/night). This hotel costs $104/night or 1.48 cents a point. This worse than staying in downtown Chicago, but still a good baseline value. (We'll convert the value into cashback percentage shortly).\n\nFinally, lets take a look at a cost comparison that better fits my hotel habits. Lets compare my Starpoints hotel stay to a travel site's best rate of a hotel that I would typically stay at.\n\nA few years ago [Clare](http://www.clarekassa.com) and I went to Disneyland in Orange County, CA. We stayed at a nice average/economy hotel [Crowne Plaza Resort Anaheim Garden Grove](http://www.crowneplaza.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/laxdl?rpb=hotel&amp;crUrl=/h/d/cp/1/en/hotelsearchresults) (I think). If booked through travelocity.com for mid-april it would cost $105/night. Alternatively, the cheapest hotel I could get with Starpoints is 3,000 points/night [staying for 8 nights] (category 2) but realistically for this trip we'd still have to spend 7,000 points a night [staying for 3 nights] (category 3). This brings the value of the Starpoints to 3.5 cents or 1.5 cents respectively.\n\nLooking at these 3 scenarios it looks like my Starpoint value is between 1.5 cents and 2 cents a point. Let's break that down into something useful.\n\n### So how much cashback?\n\nHow much does a point cost when the 25,000 point bonus is included? How much without the bonus? How does it compare with my Schwab 2% cashback on everything credit card?\n\nTo figure out the cashback % I'm going to use the following formula:\n\ndollars (cents)/point [OR value] ÷ point/dollars spent [OR cost] = cashback % [OR dollars earned/dollars spent]\n\nbut first we need to calculate the cost of a point.\n\n#### Calculating cost (including bonus points)\n\nTo get all the bonus points I need to spend $15,000 in 6 months. Don't forget, though, that I'll get points for all that spending so:\n\nSpending: $15,000 x 1 points = 15,000 points\n\n+ Bonus: 25,000 points\n\n= Total: 40,000 points for $15,000 in spending\n\n=Cost [point/dollars spent]:  37.5 cents (to clarify this is how many dollars need to be spent to earn 1 point [OR 1x = 15,000/40,000])\n\n#### Calculating cost (without bonus points)\n\nSpending: $15,000 x 1 points = 15,000 points\n\n= Total: 15,000 points for $15,000 in spending\n\n=Cost [point/dollars spent]:  1 dollar\n\n### The verdict\n\nIncluding bonus:\n\n2 cents/point value: .02 ÷ .375 =** 5.33% cashback**\n\n1.5 cents/point value: .015 ÷ .375 =** 4.0% cashback**\n\nWithout bonus:\n\n2 cents/point value: .02 ÷ 1 =** 2.0% cashback**\n\n1.5 cents/point value: .015 ÷ 1 =** 1.5% cashback**\n\nWithout a doubt this is a great card. It beats my Schwab 2% cashback credit card in quite a few scenarios. However, it doesn't beat it in the most typical scenario of choosing a nice, cheap hotel outside the Starwood group without including the bonus.\n\nBut wait! I left out one of the coolest things about this card. Look again at bullet #3 in the benefits section. You can transfer 20,000 Starpoints into 25,000 frequent flyer points. That means for 20,000 points I can get a free ticket for Madison (MSN) to San Diego (SAN) through American Airlines which would typically cost me $423.80\\. Quick - what's the cashback % of that?\n\n$423.80 [value] ÷ $20,000 [cost] =** 2.11% cashback**\n\nNow this is a better deal than my Schwab card for sure. Mixing and matching all the flexible options that the Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express makes it easily one of my new favorites.\n\nI just want to leave you with a couple of things to be careful about. There is a $45 annual fee but it's waived the first year. Also, if you are like me you are thinking \"Wow, this is a great deal but I don't think I can spend $15,000 in 6 months - that's crazy!\". This is why I have waited so long to get this card. If you want the full bonus and aren't able to use this for company travel or something similar some planning will need to take place. I waited about 9 months until all of our Paris plans were gelling and this seems like it will work well for us.\n\nIf you're interested in signing up for this card, please come back and use my referral link. At the very least I'd love to hear from you about your card experiences.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this card? Do you have a credit card that has an even better cashback percentage?

This comes out to $478 or a value of 1.99 cents a point.\n\nMore realistically I might go to Minneapolis and stay at the [Westin Edina Galleria](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1799) (category 3) for 3 nights and spend 21,000 of my points (7k/night). This hotel costs $104/night or 1.48 cents a point. This worse than staying in downtown Chicago, but still a good baseline value. (We'll convert the value into cashback percentage shortly).\n\nFinally, lets take a look at a cost comparison that better fits my hotel habits. Lets compare my Starpoints hotel stay to a travel site's best rate of a hotel that I would typically stay at.\n\nA few years ago [Clare](http://www.clarekassa.com) and I went to Disneyland in Orange County, CA. We stayed at a nice average/economy hotel [Crowne Plaza Resort Anaheim Garden Grove](http://www.crowneplaza.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/laxdl?rpb=hotel&amp;crUrl=/h/d/cp/1/en/hotelsearchresults) (I think). If booked through travelocity.com for mid-april it would cost $105/night. Alternatively, the cheapest hotel I could get with Starpoints is 3,000 points/night [staying for 8 nights] (category 2) but realistically for this trip we'd still have to spend 7,000 points a night [staying for 3 nights] (category 3). This brings the value of the Starpoints to 3.5 cents or 1.5 cents respectively.\n\nLooking at these 3 scenarios it looks like my Starpoint value is between 1.5 cents and 2 cents a point. Let's break that down into something useful.\n\n### So how much cashback?\n\nHow much does a point cost when the 25,000 point bonus is included? How much without the bonus? How does it compare with my Schwab 2% cashback on everything credit card?\n\nTo figure out the cashback % I'm going to use the following formula:\n\ndollars (cents)/point [OR value] ÷ point/dollars spent [OR cost] = cashback % [OR dollars earned/dollars spent]\n\nbut first we need to calculate the cost of a point.\n\n#### Calculating cost (including bonus points)\n\nTo get all the bonus points I need to spend $15,000 in 6 months. Don't forget, though, that I'll get points for all that spending so:\n\nSpending: $15,000 x 1 points = 15,000 points\n\n+ Bonus: 25,000 points\n\n= Total: 40,000 points for $15,000 in spending\n\n=Cost [point/dollars spent]:  37.5 cents (to clarify this is how many dollars need to be spent to earn 1 point [OR 1x = 15,000/40,000])\n\n#### Calculating cost (without bonus points)\n\nSpending: $15,000 x 1 points = 15,000 points\n\n= Total: 15,000 points for $15,000 in spending\n\n=Cost [point/dollars spent]:  1 dollar\n\n### The verdict\n\nIncluding bonus:\n\n2 cents/point value: .02 ÷ .375 =** 5.33% cashback**\n\n1.5 cents/point value: .015 ÷ .375 =** 4.0% cashback**\n\nWithout bonus:\n\n2 cents/point value: .02 ÷ 1 =** 2.0% cashback**\n\n1.5 cents/point value: .015 ÷ 1 =** 1.5% cashback**\n\nWithout a doubt this is a great card. It beats my Schwab 2% cashback credit card in quite a few scenarios. However, it doesn't beat it in the most typical scenario of choosing a nice, cheap hotel outside the Starwood group without including the bonus.\n\nBut wait! I left out one of the coolest things about this card. Look again at bullet #3 in the benefits section. You can transfer 20,000 Starpoints into 25,000 frequent flyer points. That means for 20,000 points I can get a free ticket for Madison (MSN) to San Diego (SAN) through American Airlines which would typically cost me $423.80\\. Quick - what's the cashback % of that?\n\n$423.80 [value] ÷ $20,000 [cost] =** 2.11% cashback**\n\nNow this is a better deal than my Schwab card for sure. Mixing and matching all the flexible options that the Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express makes it easily one of my new favorites.\n\nI just want to leave you with a couple of things to be careful about. There is a $45 annual fee but it's waived the first year. Also, if you are like me you are thinking \"Wow, this is a great deal but I don't think I can spend $15,000 in 6 months - that's crazy!\". This is why I have waited so long to get this card. If you want the full bonus and aren't able to use this for company travel or something similar some planning will need to take place. I waited about 9 months until all of our Paris plans were gelling and this seems like it will work well for us.\n\nIf you're interested in signing up for this card, please come back and use my referral link. At the very least I'd love to hear from you about your card experiences.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this card? Do you have a credit card that has an even better cashback percentage?

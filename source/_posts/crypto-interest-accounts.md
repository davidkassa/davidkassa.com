subtitle: Are they the new High-Yield Savings Accounts?
---

If I have any family or friends with some liquid savings sitting in Ally, Capital One 360, SoFi, Marcus, or another High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) or _even worse_ a checking or savings account, consider looking into [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=35c11f30) (referral link) as an alternative.

If you don't have much savings but are HODLing onto some cryptocurrency, consider modifying this plan to gain some interest.

## Here's the tl;dr

- Purchase USDC via [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/kassa_d5) (referral link)
- Move into [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=35c11f30)
- Gain 8.6% APY

If you follow these steps make sure you have strong, unique passwords and 2FA, and address whitelisting.

BlockFi has some pretty good instructions here: https://blockfi.com/earn-interest-coinbase/ but you should use my referral links. (:

## What is BlockFi? Is it safe?

[BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=35c11f30) is a financial institute that is focusing on cryptocurrency. It's [backed](https://blockfi.com/investors) by some big players in this space - [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/kassa_d5) (more on them later), SoFi, Gemini, and the Winklevoss twins, if you're into them.

This gives me a level of comfort that other companies in this space do not. It's not FDIC-insured but does have some insurance to protect you against security breaches (not account takeovers due to your own poor security).

So for me, it's safe enough.

## Why is it better than a HYSA?

Uhh, the rates.

Also, because you're buying USDC (USD Coin) it's pegged to the US Dollar so each coin should stay at \$1 - taking away the volatility that everyone has learned to love with traditional cryptocurrency. These are called Stablecoins and there are a whole bunch of them now. That being said, there's certainly more risk than holding a dollar somewhere. (Search for the controversy around USDT if you're interested).

Here are today's (9/28/20) rates:

## How can they offer these rates?

They say that they loan \$ using up to 200% collateral, so for a \$1000 loan they'll secure the loan with \$2000 of BTC, for example. Even with highly-volatile prices there is plenty of margin to go around so it's win-win. The individuals that borrow money get to keep their cryptocurrency (with the hopes that it'll keep going up) so it's actually win-win-win!

## I'm in! How do I do it?

### Coinbase

Sign-up for [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/kassa_d5) and get verified by them. Level 3 verification allows you to Buy or Sell via ACH up to \$25,000 per day.

Buy some USDC and wait the 4 or so days for the transfer to complete.

While you're waiting, create a USDC address and label it "BlockFi whitelist".

Sign-up for [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=35c11f30) and get verified by them.

Setup your 2FA!

Add your [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/kassa_d5) address to the Allowlist and enable it.

So I'm currently in the process of setting up my new blog. I have added a feedburner feed and have started installing some cool Wordpress plugins. If you're an early adopter, please be patient with any and all updates in the near future.

I hope to discuss quite a few thing in the coming months. Things like 529 college accounts, credit card applications, crazy finance schemes ([such as buying coins from the US Mint in bulk](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126014168569179245.html)), [folding@home](http://folding.stanford.edu/), polyphasic sleeping, programming in .NET, ruby on rails, blogging (meta-blogging), windows home server, family, vacation and whatever else my heart desires.

I'll attempt to tag these posts appropriately so you can ignore what you wish. My hopes are pretty high to think that other people will be interested in what I have to say. They're even higher to think that my audience will be varied enough to have to categorize and tag appropriately.

Here's to wishful thinking!

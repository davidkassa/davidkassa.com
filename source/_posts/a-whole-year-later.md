I started this blog about one year ago. Lets see what's happened since then.

On the personal front,

*   I started and finished doing some side-work for a small startup, [MyPayNet](http://www.mypaynet.com). I learned a lot from this and will try to share more this year.
*   Clare, Wes and I went to France for 2 weeks. You can see lots of pictures on our [Picasa ](http://picasaweb.google.com/david.kassa/France?feat=directlink)site.
*   [Wesley ](http://wesleykassa.shutterfly.com)had his [first birthday](http://wesleykassa.shutterfly.com/1382)!
*   Clare and I went to Las VegasÂ  with family and friends. Hmmm, can't find the link to those pictures -- maybe that's a good thing....
*   We put our house up for sale and hope to sell it and build a new one. We're doing this, in part, because -
*   We're expecting another baby boy around February 21st.
I have to say that that is a lot of **doing**. No wonder my blogging has slipped.

In spirit with my entrepreneurial side, I am creating a Wedding Venue Search Tool, [Wed Places](http://www.wedplaces.com). I'm still in the exploration phase so I'm trying to find a business model around this idea. I'll be providing more details around this soon. If you have any thoughts let me know.

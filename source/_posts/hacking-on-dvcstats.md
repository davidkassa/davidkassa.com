## Disney Vacation Club

For those that don't know, Clare and I bought into [Disney Vacation Club (DVC)](disneyvacationclub.disney.go.com/), Disney's timeshare program, a couple of years ago. Timeshares have a bad reputation, for good reason, but DVC seems to hold its value pretty well as there is a healthy resale market.

Being frugal, we decided to buy resale and save 40-50% from buying directly from Disney. Being overly analytical, I wanted to find out whether I was getting a good value and what the likelihood of Disney _stealing_ it through a process called Right of First Refusal (ROFR). This is a process where Disney can buy the contract, instead of you, if they think the price is too low or they're running low on their own inventory. It's one of the things that keep resale values high but can be frustrating when you're trying to get a contract of your own. I found a datasource and [built a website](https://www.dvcstats.com) - **[DVC Stats](https://www.dvcstats.com)**.

### Today

It's been a couple of years since I created [DVC Stats](https://www.dvcstats.com) and since then it has largely sat there collecting data with no real changes. I'm looking to make some additions this month as part of a [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) project so all [feedback and ideas](https://github.com/davidkassa/dvc-rofr-stats/issues) are welcome.

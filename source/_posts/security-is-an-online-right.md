This is one of my pet-peeves courtesy ofÂ  [37Signals](http://campfirenow.com/signup) (who I usually enjoy).

Security should not be an "upgrade" or an additional "feature" that needs to be paid for. Security should be considered an online right. When increased security is free everyone wins. I know that there is a cost associated with security (in this case SSL increases bandwidth).

[Google gets it.](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html) They have https on by default for all gmail users.

Sorry that my first post in a while is a rant, but I figure that if this doesn't motivate me to write a blog entry nothing will.

Every year I try to remember and spend way too much time on the ratio of alcohol to eggnog so I'm writing it down. Maybe others will find it useful.

### Notes
* Eggnog to alcohol ratio 4:1 (or 5:1)
* Half Korbel Brandy
* Half Myer's Dark Rum

_tl;dr for me next time: take the green pitcher, dump 3 pints of store-bought eggnog into it; add 1.5 cups brandy and 1.5 cups rum; stir. 4 pints won't fit after you add the alocohol._
